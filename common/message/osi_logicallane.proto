// \brief Boundary line of a LogicalLane
//
// Similar to a LaneBoundary, but with a reference line and ST positions.
//
// A logical lane boundary describes the boundary between two logical lanes. As
// such, there will always be exactly one logical lane boundary between two
// lanes at a given S position. Contrary to that, there can be 0 to N physical
// lane boundaries (i.e. type LaneBoundary) between two logical lanes at a
// given S position.
//
// If there are multiple physical lane boundaries at one S position between two
// lanes (think of a solid-broken marking, which would be described by two
// LaneBoundary objects, one for the solid lane marking, one for the broken lane
// marking), then the single LogicalLaneBoundary describing the boundary between
// two logical lanes should be between the physical boundaries.
//
// A logical lane boundary consists of a list of \link LogicalBoundaryPoint
// LogicalBoundaryPoints\endlink. Each point has a XYZ and an ST coordinate.
// The XYZ coordinates describe the position and height of the boundary in the
// world.
//
// Notes on design decisions:
// - The LogicalLaneBoundary has ST coordinates, and is thus a separate type
//   from LaneBoundary.
//   Advantages of this decision:
//   - Calculations like getting the lane width at a position are easy, since
//     one can just get the boundary points of the left and right boundary at
//     the desired S position (via linear interpolation), and calculate the
//     width from the two points. Also getting something like the distance to
//     the lane border is very easy.
//   - No centerline of the lane is necessary, since this can very easily be
//     generated from the boundaries.
//   Disadvantages of this decision:
//   - %Lane boundaries cannot be shared with physical lanes. This results in
//     more data needed. This can mostly be mitigated by only transmitting the
//     lane boundaries during initialization (e.g. via the OSMP GroundTruthInit
//     message).
// - The LogicalLaneBoundary contains all data directly which an agent model is
//   likely to need. It does not include information normally only used by
//   sensor models (e.g. the exact length of the color markings on the road).
//   This information can be gotten from the physical lane referenced in the
//   LogicalLane, if needed.

  // The boundary must be defined in the same direction as the reference

  // /
  // ---------- reference line --------------
  // </pre>
  // At the place where the boundary suddenly increases, two points will have
  // the same S coordinate.
  //
  // If the boundary approximates a curve (e.g. a cubic function in
  // OpenDRIVE), the points must be chosen in a way that the lateral distance
  // to the ideal line does not exceed 5cm. As shown in the following image:
  //
  // \image html line_approximation_error.svg "Approximation error"
  // Approximation error green line.
  //
  // The Z error (difference in Z height between #boundary_line and the
  // "real" line) must not exceed 2cm. This is a stricter requirement than
  // for errors in the XY plane, because Z differences between lanes
  // influence driving very much.
  //
  // Note: if two lanes have different Z heights (e.g. a driving lane is

  // then these lanes cannot share a boundary, since their boundaries have

  //   a lane.
  // - In the common case, this will contain one physical boundary.
  // - This list contains several lane boundaries if there are several physical
  //   lane boundaries at one S position (e.g. both a broken and a solid
  //   line).
  // - If there are several lane boundaries, they must be listed in increasing
  //   T order (i.e. from right to left in reference line direction).
  //   Rationale: this makes it easier to determine e.g. rules on lane
  //   changes, which depend on the T order of the lanes.
  // - Whenever physical lane boundaries begin or end, or switch their T
  //   position (if there are multiple physical lane boundaries), a new
  //   LogicalLaneBoundary must be created.
  // - The referenced LaneBoundary objects may be longer than the
  //   LogicalLaneBoundary which references them, but must never be shorter.

  // <pre>
  //       Lane 1

// \brief A logical lane in the road network.
//
// A logical lane is part of a road. Compared to a physical lane (OSI type
// \c Lane), its existence doesn't hinge on the existence of road markings. So
// e.g. a road with two driving directions but no road markings in-between
// would be presented as two \link LogicalLane LogicalLanes\endlink, but only
// one Lane. So one Lane can consist of multiple \link LogicalLane
// LogicalLanes\endlink. E.g. on intersections, each driving path is one
// LogicalLane, but the whole area is one \c Lane of type \link
// osi3::Lane::Classification::TYPE_INTERSECTION \c TYPE_INTERSECTION \endlink.
//
// Outside of intersections, logical lanes are constructed such that each point on
// the road belongs to at least one (typically: exactly one) logical lane. So
// there are no gaps between logical lanes, and no areas that don't belong to a
// logical lane.
//
// If OSI is generated from OpenDRIVE, then \link LogicalLane
// LogicalLanes\endlink map directly to OpenDRIVE lanes. However, it is allowed
// to merge multiple consecutive (in S direction) OpenDRIVE lanes with the same
// type into one OSI LogicalLane: if an OpenDRIVE lane has a single successor,
// which has the same lane type, and this successor has only one predecessor
// (so no lane merging or splitting) then the two lanes may be presented as one
// continuous LogicalLane. This may be done recursively.
//
// The \link ReferenceLine reference line\endlink pointed to by
// #reference_line_id defines an ST coordinate system for the lane. This ST
// coordinate system is used to describe positions on the lane.
//
// ## Example
//
// The example below shows two logical lanes on an intersection, with a focus
// on the left-turn lane (\c l1):
// \image html OSI_LogicalLane1.png "Two logical lanes on an intersection"
//
// Assumptions not shown in the image:
// - This is right-hand traffic (and thus vehicles on \c l1 drive from the bottom
//   to the left, vehicles on \c l2 drive from right to left).
// - The yellow line is a ReferenceLine, defined starting at the bottom, and
//   going to the left.
//
// Some features shown in the image relative to \c l1:
// - The yellow line is the ReferenceLine of \c l1 . The ReferenceLine can be
//   shared with other lanes.  Because the ReferenceLine has the same direction
//   as the driving direction of \c l1 in this example,
//   <code>#move_direction == #MOVE_DIRECTION_INCREASING_S</code>.
// - The red line marks the area where \c l2 is left of
//   \c l1 - this info is recorded in #left_adjacent_lane of \c l1.
// - The red area is the area where \c l2 overlaps \c l1. This is recorded in
//   #overlapping_lane of \c l1.
//
// The image below shows the same two lanes, but from the perspective of \c l2:
// \image html OSI_LogicalLane2.png "Two logical lanes on an intersection"
//
// Assumptions not shown in the image:
// - The yellow line is a ReferenceLine, defined starting at the right, going
//   to the left.
//
// Some features shown in the image relative to \c l2:
// - The yellow line is the ReferenceLine of \c l2 . The ReferenceLine can be
//   shared with other lanes.  Because the ReferenceLine has the same direction

//   <code>#move_direction == #MOVE_DIRECTION_INCREASING_S</code>.
// - The green line marks the area where \c l1 is right of
//   \c l2 - this info is recorded in #right_adjacent_lane of \c l2.
// - The red area is the area where \c l1 overlaps \c l2. This is recorded in
//   #overlapping_lane of \c l1.
//
// As can be seen in the images, the two highlighted lanes are neighbours for
// part of their length, but it makes no sense for them to have the same
// reference line, since they diverge significantly.
//
