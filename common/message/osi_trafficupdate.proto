// \brief The traffic update message is provided by traffic participant
// models to provide updates to their position, state and future
// trajectory back to the simulation environment. The message is
// designed to update data of exactly one traffic participant,
// optionally with an attached trailer.
//
// \note For reasons of convenience and consistency, the updated
// information is provided as a MovingObject.  Certain fields of this
// sub-message are not required to be set and will be ignored by the
// simulation environment, because they are static information.
// Instead of creating a seperate message type for only the non-static
// information, re-use existing message.
//
message TrafficUpdate {
  // The interface version used by the sender (traffic participant model).

  // The data timestamp of the simulation environment. Zero time is arbitrary
  // but must be identical for all messages. Zero time does not need to
  // coincide with the UNIX epoch. Recommended is the starting time point of
  // the simulation.
  //
  // \note For moving object update data the timestamp coincides both with
  // the notional simulation time the data applies to and the time it was sent.
  // There is no inherent latency for moving object update data, as opposed
  // to sensor data.

  // \note It is not expected that static fields are populated. If they
  // are, they may be ignored by the receiver of this message, for example, dimensions,
  // or vehicle category.  All dynamic fields should be populated where known,
  // for example, velocity, light states, or future trajectory.
  //
  // \note The field is repeated because it is possible to have a trailer attached to
  // a vehicle, see MovingObject::VehicleClassification::has_trailer and
  // MovingObject::VehicleClassification::trailer_id.

  // Internal state for each vehicle.
  //
  // This is an optional field as internal state may not be known or relevant,
  // for example, a trailer might not have any internal state.
  // It is also allowed to only specify internal_state for a subset of the
  // objects referenced in the update.
  //
  // \note This covers any information which cannot be externally perceived
  // and therefore cannot be included in messages available in ground truth.
  //
  // \note The id field from this should match the id in the update field
  // above where the same vehicle is being referenced.
