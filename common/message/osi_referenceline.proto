// \brief A reference line for defining a non-euclidean ST coordinate system
//
// A reference line is a 3D polyline, used for generating a non-euclidean
// ST coordinate system.
//
// Notes on design decisions:
// - This is a polyline, and not some more complex curve. The advantage of a
//   polyline is that it is very simple to generate from various map formats,
//   and it is also easy to handle. The downside is that a polyline has no
//   direct curvature, and even the angle is not continuous (only C0 smooth).
//   In the author's experience, the benefits of a polyline outweigh the costs.

  // Points comprising the polyline.
  //
  // At least 2 points must be given.
  // The polyline is defined as the lines between consecutive points.
  // Each point has an S coordinate.
  //
  // ## Rules on the S position
  //
  // There are a few requirements on the S position:
  // - Later points in the list must have strictly larger S coordinates than
  //   earlier points.
  // - For consecutive points, the S difference between them  must be at
  //   least as large as the 2D euclidean distance between the points (2D
  //   distance == euclidean distance between the points taking only X and Y
  //   into account).
  // - The S distance between two points may be larger than the 2D euclidean
  //   distance, but should be not much larger. It is allowed to be larger if
  //   the underlying reference line (e.g. in an OpenDRIVE map) is a curve,
  //   and thus the sampled reference line has a smaller length than the original
  //   curve.
  //
  // Together, these rules allow directly putting OpenDRIVE S coordinates
  // into an OSI ReferenceLine.
  //
  // If the reference line approximates a curve (e.g. a clothoid in
  // OpenDRIVE), the points must be chosen in a way that the lateral distance
  // to the ideal line does not exceed 5cm. As shown in the following image:
  //
  // \image html line_approximation_error.svg "Approximation error"
  // Approximation error green line.
  //
  // Between two ReferenceLinePoints, both the world coordinate and the S
  // coordinate is interpolated linearly. So each S value uniquely describes
  // a point on the polyline.
  //
  // ## Extending the coordinate system infinitely
  //
  // For the purpose of this discussion, let's call the S position of the
  // first point \c sStart, and the S position of the last point \c sEnd.
  //
  // For some purposes, S positions outside the normally defined range (i.e.
  // outside [\c sStart,\c sEnd]) need to be defined. For this purpose, the
  // first line of the polyline is infinitely extended in negative S
  // direction.  Similarly, the last line of the polyline is infinitely
  // extended beyond the last point. The S value of points outside [\c
  // sStart,\c sEnd] is defined by the euclidean 2D distance from the start
  // or end point, respectively.  So if <code>sStart = 15</code>, and a point
  // is on the line extended from the start position, with a 2D euclidean
  // distance of 10 from the first point, then it has an S position of 5.
  //
  // A point is "before" the reference line, if its s coordinate is < \c sStart.
  // A point is "after" the reference line, if its s coordinate is > \c sEnd.
  //
  // ## Adding T coordinates
  //
  // To describe points that are not directly on the polyline, a T coordinate
  // is added. T is the signed 2D distance (i.e. <code>hypot(A.X-B.X,
  // A.Y-B.Y)</code>, if A and B are the two points) between the point to
  // describe and the nearest point on the polyline (this point might either
  // be on a line segment or at an edge between two line segments). The
  // distance is positive if the point is left of the polyline (in definition
  // direction), negative if it is right of it.
  // The S position of such a point outside the reference line is the same as
  // the S value of the nearest point on the polyline.
  //
  // Notes:
  // - The "nearest point on the polyline" is determined in 3D (even if the
  //   resulting T value is only the 2D distance), in order to choose the
  //   correct point for 3D curves (think reference lines for roads in parking
  //   decks).
  // - If there are several "nearest points", the one with the smallest S
  //   coordinate on the polyline is chosen.
  //
  // ## Defining angles
  //
  // Sometimes an angle to a reference line is needed. This shall be defined
  // as follows:
  // First the nearest point on the polyline is determined, as described
  // above. If this point is on a line segment, then the angle is calculated
  // relative to the line segment on which the reference point lays.
  // If the nearest point is at the edge between line segments, then the
  // angle of the following line shall be chosen.
  //
  // ## Converting between world coordinates and ST coordinates
  //
  // The above rules define an ST coordinate system across the whole XY plane.
  // Every XY position has a ST coordinate, but not necessarily a unique ST
  // coordinate.
  //
  // Example:
  // \image html OSI_ReferenceLine1.svg
  //
  // This shows a reference line (consisting of three points), and five points
  // not on the reference line.
  //
  // - For \c P1, the situation is clear, since there is exactly one nearest
  //   point on the polyline. The resulting ST coordinate uniquely maps back
  //   to \c P1.
  // - \c P2 has multiple points "nearest points" on the polyline.
  //   As can be seen here, two  ST coordinates map to \c P2 (red and grey
  //   dotted line).  Following the rules above, the one with the smallest S
  //   value is chosen (the red dotted line).
  // - \c P3 has a unique "nearest point" on the polyline. However, multiple
  //   points map to the same ST coordinate as that of \c P3, e.g. \c P4
  //   (drawn in grey).
  // - Finally, \c P5 shows how the reference line is extended infinitely for
  //   points that are "outside" the reference line.
  //
  // The sampling of the polyline must be chosen such that the error
  // when converting coordinates is "small enough". The exact needed
  // precision is defined for each user, where the reference line is
  // referenced.
  //
  // ## Creating reference lines
  //
  // When OSI is generated from OpenDRIVE, typically the reference lines will
  // be taken directly from the road reference lines in OpenDRIVE, and
  // sampled according to the accuracy requirements outlined above.
  //
  // Other map formats may not have reference lines, so they will have to be
  // synthesized by the tool generating OSI data. A few guidelines on this
  // process:
  //
  // - The reference line should follow the road
  // - It is preferable to have the reference line in the center of the road
  //   (e.g. on a highway, it should be in the middle between the two driving
  //   directions). Rationale: this makes S differences better approximate
  //   euclidean distances, compared to having the reference line at one side
  //   of a curvy road.
  //
  // ## Various notes
  //
  // Notes on OpenDRIVE compatibility:
  // Ideally, one would want the polyline to be fully compatible with
  // OpenDRIVE, so that calculations done for OpenDRIVE directly match those
  // in OSI. There are a few difficulties with this:
  // - The T coordinate is nearly the same as for OpenDRIVE, but
  //   unfortunately not perfectly. In OpenDRIVE, if the road is tilted using
  //   superElevation, then the t coordinate system is tilted along, so the T
  //   coordinate is no longer calculated in the XY plane (as proposed for
  //   OSI). It doesn't seem feasable to implement the same tilting for OSI,
  //   so simulation tools will have to consider superElevation and convert
  //   the T coordinate accordingly: <code>t_OSI = t_OpenDRIVE *
  //   cos(alpha)</code>, where alpha is the superelevation angle.
  // - The angle will not be perfectly the same, due to the use of line
  //   segments in OSI, and curves in OpenDRIVE. In the authors opinion, the
  //   difference will be negligible if the #poly_line is suitably sampled.
  //
  // Notes on design decisions:
  // - The S coordinate is included directly, both for OpenDRIVE
  //   compatibility, and to speed up calculations.
  // - The rules on S coordinates (e.g. the calculation in 2D space) are
  //   there to ensure OpenDRIVE compatibility.
  // - The rules on T coordinates are there to ensure OpenDRIVE compatibility
  //   for lanes without superelevation, and to make it easier to convert
  //   between OSI and OpenDRIVE in case superelevation is present.
