// \brief The ground truth information from the simulation environment.
//
// This ground truth information is supposed to describe the whole simulated
// environment around any simulated vehicle. For each simulated host vehicle
// (there may be one or multiple), define an area around the vehicle which
// is greater than the combined field of views (FOV) of all obstructed sensors
// in the vehicle. The ground truth data is supposed to describe the convex
// hull of all such areas w.r.t. a global simulation coordinate system.
//
// The simulation coordinate system may change during the simulation if and
// only if all coordinates w.r.t. this coordinate system are also changed.
//
// The data has to be sent at a rate defined by the receiving partner. When
// sending, values with default values might be left default in order to improve
// performance.
//
// To provide a complete interface, all fields of all contained messages must be
// properly set unless specifically stated in the field's definition that the
// field may remain unset.
//
// In enums (e.g. types) the unknown (first / default) value is not allowed to
// be used in the ground truth interface.

  //
  // \note For ground truth data this timestamp coincides both with the
  // notional simulation time the data applies to and the time it was sent
  // (there is no inherent latency for ground truth data, as opposed to
  // sensor data).
